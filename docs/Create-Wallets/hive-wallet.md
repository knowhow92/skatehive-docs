**2.** Pick an available username and click on "continue"

**3.** At the next page, click on "Download Backup" to download your Hive account keys (or passwords). Make sure you save them in a very secure place. If you loose access to your keys you loose access to your Hive account. (No account recovery). Also click on "Copy Clipboard" so you can move to the next step.
